# Movie-Recommendation-Tool

In this repository, I have built Movie Recommendation Tool that recommend the movies name according to the user's given input.(movie name, keyword, theme, etc)

### Recommendattion system

Recommendation systems improve the quality of search results and provide elements that are more relevant to the search item or that are related to the search history of the user. Recommendation systems are widely used to recommend movies, items, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy, etc.

### Approach

- Choosing required columns for recommendation
- Data Cleaning
- Convert the raw data to feature vector using Tfidftransformer & Tfidfvectorizer
- Data Transformation
- Fetching Information


### To build this tool, I have used 'Cosine Similarity' recommendation stretegy and get the list of recommended movies by fetching and analysing the similarity score.
